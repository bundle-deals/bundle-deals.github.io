Stocks are one of the keys to developing long-term wealth. The problem with stocks is that, while they can grow in value enormously over time, their day-to-day movement is impossible to anticipate with 100% precision.

This raises the question of how to earn money from stocks. Actually, it isn't difficult if you follow some tried-and-true procedures and exercise patience.

<br/><br/>

### **Put Your Dividends Back Into the Stock Market**

<br/>

Many companies pay their shareholders a dividend, which is a recurring payment depending on their profits.

While the little sums you receive in dividends may appear insignificant at first, they are responsible for a significant share of the stock market's historic growth. The S&P 500 had an average annual return of 6.7 percent from September 1921 to September 2021. However, when dividends were reinvested, the proportion increased to nearly 11%! That's because reinvesting your dividends buys you more stock, allowing your earnings to compound even faster.

Because of the increased compounding, many financial consultants advise long-term investors to reinvest their earnings rather than spending them as soon as they are received. By enrolling in a dividend reinvestment program, or DRIP, most brokerage firms allow you to reinvest your dividends automatically.

### **Select the Appropriate Investment Account**

<br/>

Though the investments you choose are unquestionably significant to your long-term investing success, the account in which you keep them is equally critical.

This is because some investment accounts provide you with tax benefits such as immediate tax deductions (conventional retirement accounts) or eventual tax-free withdrawals (Roth). Regardless of which option you choose, you will be able to avoid paying taxes on any profits or income you earn while the funds are in the account. This can help you boost your retirement savings by deferring taxes on positive returns for decades.

However, these advantages come at a price. You can't take money out of retirement accounts like 401(k)s or individual retirement accounts (IRAs) before you turn 59 without incurring a 10% penalty plus any taxes owed.

Of However, certain conditions, such as high medical bills or [dealing with the economic consequences from the Covid-19](https://www.internetdailydeals.com/make-money-online-while-at-home-during-pandemic/) outbreak, allow you to use that money early and without penalty. However, after you've deposited money into a tax-advantaged retirement account, it's best not to touch it until you've reached retirement age.

Meanwhile, traditional taxable investment accounts don't offer the same tax benefits, but they do allow you to withdraw funds whenever you want for any reason. This enables you to take advantage of tactics such as tax-loss harvesting, which entails turning lost stocks into winners by selling them at a loss and receiving a tax credit on some of your gains. In addition, you can contribute an unlimited amount to taxable accounts each year; 401(k)s and IRAs have annual limits.

To summarize, you must invest in the "correct" account to maximize your profits. Taxable accounts may be a smart place to keep investments that lose less of their returns to taxes, or money that you may need in the next years or decade. Investing in tax-advantaged accounts, on the other hand, may be better suited for investments that are likely to lose more of their returns to taxes or that you want to retain for a long time.

Most brokerages offer both types of investing accounts, so check to see if the one you want is available.

### **Invest in Funds Rather Than Individual Stocks**

<br/>

**Diversification**, a tried-and-true investing strategy for lowering risk and potentially increasing returns over time, is well-known among seasoned investors. Consider it the equivalent of not placing all of your eggs in one basket when it comes to investing.

Although most investors choose individual stocks or stock funds such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), experts normally advocate the latter to maximize diversification.

While you can buy a variety of individual stocks to mimic the diversification found in mutual funds, doing so successfully takes time, a fair degree of investing expertise, and a large capital investment. A single share of stock, for example, can be worth hundreds of dollars.

Funds, on the other hand, allow you to buy a single share of exposure to hundreds or thousands of distinct investments. While everyone wants to invest their entire portfolio in the next [Apple (AAPL)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/) or [Tesla (TSLA)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/), the truth is that most investors, including professionals, have a poor track record of correctly predicting which firms will provide large returns.

That's why most experts advise people to put their money in funds that track large indexes like Nasdaq. This puts you in the best position to profit from the stock market's around 10% average yearly returns as readily as possible.

<br/><br/>

### **Buy and Hold**

<br/>

Long-term investors have a saying that "time in the market beats timing the market."

What exactly does that imply? In brief, one common technique to make money in stocks is to use a buy-and-hold strategy, which involves holding stocks or other securities for a long period rather than purchasing and selling or trading frequently.

This is significant because investors that trade in and out of the market on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis miss out on possibilities to earn high annual returns. Do you have any doubts?

Those who stayed completely engaged in the stock market for the 15 years leading up to 2017 had an [annual return of 9.9%](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/make-money-in-stocks). However, if you jumped in and out of the market, your prospects of realizing those profits were endangered.<br/><br/>

* Investors who missed only ten of the finest days throughout that time period saw only a 5% annual return.
* For individuals who missed the 20 best days, the annual return was only 2%.
* Missing the 30 greatest days resulted in a -0.4 percent annual loss on average.

<br/><br/>

Clearly, missing out on the market's greatest days results in significantly lesser returns. While it may appear that the simple approach is to constantly make sure you're invested on those days, it's impossible to know when they'll occur, and days of excellent performance can sometimes follow days of significant drops.

That means you'll need to stay involved for the long run if you want to take advantage of the stock market's best opportunities. A buy-and-hold approach can assist you in achieving this goal and it helps you save money on taxes by qualifying you for lesser capital gains taxes.

### **Final Thoughts**

<br/>

You don't have to spend your days betting on which specific firms' stocks will rise or fall in the short term if you want to [earn money](https://www.internetdailydeals.com/7-ways-to-make-100-a-day/) in stocks. Even the most successful investors, such as Warren Buffett, advise individuals to put their money in low-cost index funds and keep them for years or decades until they need it.

Unfortunately, the tried-and-true approach to successful investing is a little boring. Instead of chasing the current hot company, have patience and trust that diversified investments, such as index funds, will pay off in the long run.
