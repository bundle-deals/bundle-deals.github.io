    "body": "   The Wordle answer for today  {{  Today  | date:  %b %d  }} is       word. . .         Wordle is a popular  online word-guessing game that has been sweeping the internet by storm.   Created by Jonathan Feinberg, a software engineer from New York, this  addictive game is not only fun but also helps improve vocabulary and  cognitive skills. In this article, we will explore the game of Wordle, how  it works, and provide some helpful tips and tricks to improve your gameplay.   What is Wordle?:    Wordle is an online word-guessing game where the player has to guess a  five-letter word in six attempts. The game presents a blank slate with five  boxes representing each letter of the word. The player inputs a word into  the boxes, and the game highlights each letter in green if it is present in  the target word and yellow if it is in the wrong place.     The goal is to guess the target word within six attempts by using the  feedback provided by the game. The game can be played for free on the  website wordle. io, and players can compete with their friends or challenge  themselves to improve their gameplay.   How Does Wordle Work?:    Wordle works by presenting the player with a blank slate and a five-letter  target word. The player then inputs a five-letter word into the blank slate,  and the game provides feedback in the form of green and yellow boxes.     A green box indicates that the corresponding letter is present in the target  word and is in the correct position. A yellow box indicates that the  corresponding letter is present in the target word but is not in the correct  position.     Using this feedback, the player has to guess the target word within six  attempts. If the player is unable to guess the target word within six  attempts, the game ends, and the target word is revealed.     Tips and Tricks for Playing Wordle :  Here are some helpful tips and tricks that can improve your gameplay:       Start with vowels: As there are only five letters in the   target word, starting with vowels can help narrow down the possibilities.    This strategy can help eliminate a lot of the less common letters.        Pay attention to the feedback: The feedback provided by   the game is essential to make progress. Use it to your advantage to   eliminate possibilities and narrow down the target word.        Use common letter combinations: In the English language,   some letter combinations are more common than others, such as   &quot;th,&quot; &quot;ch,&quot; and &quot;sh. &quot; Using these letter   combinations can help you make progress and narrow down the target word.        Use process of elimination: As the game progresses,   eliminate letters that have already been used in previous attempts. This   strategy can help you narrow down the target word and make progress.        Keep a list of previously used letters: Keeping a list of   previously used letters can help you avoid repeating letters and make   progress towards the target word.     Conclusion:    Wordle is a fun and addictive game that not only entertains but also helps  improve cognitive skills and vocabulary. By following the tips and tricks  mentioned above, players can improve their gameplay and increase their  chances of guessing the target word within six attempts.  "
